## Questions

1. Write a program to create a SET A and determine the cardinality of SET for an input array of elements (repetition allowed) and perform the following operations on the SET:<br>
a) ismember (a, A): check whether an element belongs to set or not and return value as true/false.<br>
b) powerset A): list all the elements of power set of A.

2. Create a class SET and take two sets as input from user to perform following SET Operations:<br>
a) Subset: Check whether one set is a subset of other or not.<br>
b) Union and Intersection of two Sets.<br>
c) Complement: Assume Universal Set as per the input elements from the user.<br>
d) Set Difference and Symmetric Difference between two SETS.<br>
e) Cartesian Product of Sets.<br>

3. Write a Program to implement Tower of Hanoi using recursion.

4. Create a class RELATION, use Matrix notation to represent a relation. Include functions to check if a relation is reflexive, Symmetric, Anti-symmetric and Transitive. Write a program to use this class.

5. Write a program to check whether the given relation is:<br>
a) Equivalent, or<br>
b) Partial Order relation, or<br>
c) None<br>

6. Write a Program to generate the Fibonacci Series using recursion.

7. Write a Program to store a function (polynomial/exponential), and then evaluate the polynomial.
(For example store f (x) = 4n^3 + 2n + 9 in an array and for a given value of n, say n = 5, evaluate (i.e. compute the value of f (5)).

8. Write a Program that generates all the permutations of a given set of digits, with or without repetition. 
(For example, if the given set is {1, 2}, the permutations are 12 and 21).

9. Write a program to accept an input n from the user and graphically represent the values of  T(n) where n varies from 0 to n for the recurrence relations. 
For e.g. T(n) = T(n-1) + n, T(0) = 1, T(n) = T(n-1) + n^2, T(0) =1, T(n) = 2*T(n)/2 + n, T(1)=1.

10. In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one).

You have the following constraints:

(1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
(2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower.
(3) A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk. Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the
last using Stacks.

Write CPP code to find the most optimum solutions.
