## Questions

1. Write a program to create a SET A and determine the cardinality of SET for an input array of elements (repetition allowed) and perform the following operations on the SET:<br>
(a) ismember (a, A): check whether an element belongs to set or not and return value as true/false.<br>
(b) powerset A): list all the elements of power set of A.

2. Create a class SET and take two sets as input from user to perform following SET Operations:<br>
a) Subset: Check whether one set is a subset of other or not.<br>
b) Union and Intersection of two Sets.<br>
c) Complement: Assume Universal Set as per the input elements from the user.<br>
d) Set Difference and Symmetric Difference between two SETS.<br>
e) Cartesian Product of Sets.<br>

3. Write a Program to implement Tower of Hanoi using recursion.

4. Create a class RELATION, use Matrix notation to represent a relation. Include functions to check if a relation is reflexive, Symmetric, Anti-symmetric and Transitive. Write a program to use this class.

5. Write a program to check whether the given relation is:<br>
a) Equivalent, or<br>
b) Partial Order relation, or<br>
c) None<br>

6. Write a Program to generate the Fibonacci Series using recursion.

7. Write a Program to store a function (polynomial/exponential), and then evaluate the polynomial.
(For example store f (x) = 4n^3 + 2n + 9 in an array and for a given value of n, say n = 5, evaluate (i.e. compute the value of f (5)).

8. Write a Program that generates all the permutations of a given set of digits, with or without repetition. 
(For example, if the given set is {1, 2}, the permutations are 12 and 21).

9. Write a program to accept an input n from the user and graphically represent the values of  T(n) where n varies from 0 to n for the recurrence relations. 
For e.g. T(n) = T(n-1) + n, T(0) = 1, T(n) = T(n-1) + n^2, T(0) =1, T(n) = 2*T(n)/2 + n, T(1)=1.
